## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Brainless]

### Project Description
[Ever felt too lazy to get up when your alarm rings? Reverse Alarm rewards you for staying in bed instead of waking up. The longer you sleep, the happier it gets! üò¥üõè]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People keep waking up on time and ruining their perfectly good sleep schedules. Alarms are out here destroying dreams‚Äîliterally!]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We built an alarm that celebrates your laziness ‚Äî the longer you stay in bed, the more it praises you. Sleep more, win more. It‚Äôs the anti-alarm revolution! üò¥üéâ]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Python]
- [None(Just plain Python magic ‚ú®)]
- [time- for delays and time tracking
- datetime- to check the current time and compare with alarm time
- ctypes- to detect system idle time (windows only)
- winsound- (optional, standard windows audio library- though not actively used here)
- pygame- to play the alarm sound using a .mp3 file]
- [VS code
- GitHub
- Terminal/ Command Prompt
- Windows OS (since idle detection uses windows APIs)]


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[git clone https://github.com/Neethu314/reverse-alarm.git
cd reverse-alarm
pip install pygame]

# Run
[commands]

](code-output window)
This screenshot shows the Reverse Alarm Python script open in Visual Studio Code, highlighting the section where the program detects user inactivity using Windows APIs (ctypes). 
The terminal below indicates that the script is being executed via PowerShell within VS Code.

](detecting any movements)
The Python script sets an alarm based on system idle time using ctypes, pygame, and tkinter. It‚Äôs running successfully in VS Code.
